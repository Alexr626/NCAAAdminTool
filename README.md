# NCAA Admin Tool

A group project in which we decided to model an NCAA basketball league's administrative database. We focused on teams and 
associated player data to help us gain insight on what makes a basketball team successful.  The database modelled the 
following aspects: NCAA team, games, players, head coach, event highlights, venues, mascot, and financial transactions. 
My contribution to the project was the creation of the SQL queries that created tables of the aspects of the database
listed previously, as well as assistance in creating the ER diagrams and functional relations used in the brainstorming
of the implementation.

## Setup Instructions

This tech stack for this project is PHP, HTML+CSS. To access the databsase, install MAMP [HERE](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/).

Once that is done, choose the directory containing the src folder under **Preferences -> Server -> Choose**.

As it starts, re-navigate back to the homepage of the NCAA Database (http://localhost:8888/index.php).
