## Description of challenges/things left to do

There are some challenges to this project since none of the team members have previously used CSS+HTML for a PHP-based project. Therefore, to help with this problem, we've assigned supporting roles in case one or more of the members require additional help.
This goes for the more complex query types too (eg: nested aggregation, division, etc.)
